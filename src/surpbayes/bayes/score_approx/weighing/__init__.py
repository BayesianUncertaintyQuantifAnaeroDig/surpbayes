Weighting step for score_approximation Bayesian inference framework.

Sub module for weighing a sample of points in order to approximate a distribution.

Methods in the Bayesian calibration module rely on estimation of integrals with respect to
variable distributions $\pi(\theta)$.

These integrals typically involve a function $f$ which is costly to evaluate. Previous evaluations
of $f$ at a fixed sample $(x_i)$ is available.

The goal of the present module is to compute weights $(\omega_i)$, such that
    $$\sum g(x_i)\omega_i \simeq  \pi(\theta)[g] $$
for all function $g$.
